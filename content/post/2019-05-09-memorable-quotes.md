> Follow the noise. […] the source of the noise turned out to be most  interesting and unexpected. In the research that forms the basis of  chaos theory, it is   often the exploration of variability and apparent  noise - random-appearing signals from physical and physiological systems  - that has been the starting point for progress.

> [A living organism] … feeds upon negative entropy … Thus the device  by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level  of orderliness (= fairly low level of entropy) really consists in  continually sucking orderliness from its environment.

> Now entropy is a measure of how many ways I can rearrange those  grains and still keep the sand pile the same […] Entropy always  increases… because it’s overwhelmingly more likely that it will.

> The most impressive fact is that gravity is simple. It is simple to  state the principles completely and not have left any vagueness for  anybody to change the ideas of the law. It is simple, and therefore it  is beautiful. It is simple in its pattern. I do not mean it is simple in  its action—the motions of the various planets and the perturbations of  one on the other can be quite complicated to work out, and to follow how  all those stars in a globular cluster move is quite beyond our ability.  It is complicated in its actions, but the basic pattern or the system  beneath the whole thing is simple. This is common to all our laws; they  all turn out to be simple things, although complex in their actual  actions.
